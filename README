BeTTeR Linux
============

Back To The Roots Linux. Name pinched from `Leonard Techel <https://github.com/barnslig>`_.

Installation
------------

The installation of BTTR Linux is complicated. You have to build a sane crosscompiler environment and then you have to build all base packages. This process is complicated due to misdesign in glibc and gcc, and therefore we're referring only to the `Linux from Scratch project <http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/>`_, which provides a manual describing the building of a crosscompiler toolchain. Otherwise give us some time to produce a live system.

Ports
-----

The base of BTTR Linux is the ports tree, which consists of a large amount of
ports. Each package is based in a port, therefore we're using the same separation
as BSD systems between ports and packages: Ports are the build description while
packages are built ports (also known as binary packages).

+------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| fetch      | Ensure that any source code was fetched and no       |
|            | outgoing connections are necessary                   |
+------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| unpack     | Ensure that the source code was unpacked             |
+------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| patch      | Ensure that any source code was patched              |
+------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| prepare    | Ensure that any resources necessary for building are |
|            | present                                              |
+------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| configure  | Ensure that the source tree was configured and is    |
|            | ready for compilation                                |
+------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| build      | Ensure that all files were built from source code    |
+------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| install    | Ensure that all files were installed to DESTDIR      |
+------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| clean      | Ensure that all files except source code             |
|            | repositories were removed                            |
+------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| distclean  | Ensure that all files except repository files were   |
|            | removed                                              |
+------------+------------------------------------------------------+

These targets are used by our package building tools and port management tools, so have to implement them correctly.

Furthermore, there are also variables with special meaning:

+---------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| PREFIX        | Prefix for package files                          |
+---------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| DESTDIR       | Directory to install files                        |
+---------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| FETCH         | Program to fetch remote files (mirrorfetch, curl) |
+---------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| WITH_xxx      | Enable feature xxx if value is "yes"              |
+---------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| WITHOUT_xxx   | Disable feature xxx if value is "yes"             |
+---------------+---------------------------------------------------+

To allow useful packaging and version management, you should supply a Version
file in each port. You can also add a Makefile rule to produce that Version file.

Bootstrapping
-------------

The bootstrapping of a BTTR Linux system is done by using the Makefile.bootstrap Makefile, which includes a configuration and builds the packages using recursive make calls.

You can control the bootstrapping process by several environment variables:

+----------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| CONFIG   | Makefile to evaluate after startup, if omitted, will   |
|          | evaluate default.bootstrap.mk                          |
+----------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| DESTDIR  | Root directory of the bootstrapped system, if omitted, |
|          | will be a temporary directory                          |
+----------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| TARGETS  | Targets which shall be executed, by default build and  |
|          | install                                                |
+----------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| PACKAGES | Packages which will installed                          |
+----------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| MAKE_LOG | Pattern for output files for output ofpackage build    |
|          | processes, %p will replaced by the package name        |
+----------+--------------------------------------------------------+

    make -f Makefile.bootstrap bootstrap
