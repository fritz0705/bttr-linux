                           Uranium Linux Distribution

  Uranium Linux is a source-based Linux Distribution, which is similar to other
source-based Linux Distributions like Gentoo[1] or Exherbo[2], but also to
BSD operating systems like FreeBSD[3] and NetBSD[4]. It tries to use Makefiles
as a package build system like BSD ports does, in addition to the effort to
compile mostly without patches.
